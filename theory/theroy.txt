The ATmega328P has 1024 bytes of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)
available for use by programs.

EEPROM memory is similar to the ROM memory in that the data in it is
retained (non-volatile) when the power to the chip is turned off, but the contents can be modified by the
program similar to how RAM is used
