UCSRnA = is a control and status register for the USART module in AVR microcontrollers,
containing various bits to monitor and control USART operations.
Checking specific bits like UDREn helps in managing the USART data flow effectively.


UDREn = (USART Data Register Empty), if this is set to 1 we can transmit Data
